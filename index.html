            The Snack Wrap was a menu item that was available at McDonald's in
            the United States in 2006. It consists of 100% white meat chicken
            breast (crispy or grilled), lettuce, shredded cheddar jack cheese,
            Monterey Jack cheese, and sauce (ranch, honey mustard, or salsa
            roja), wrapped in a soft flour tortilla.
          </p>
          <p>
            This site is a homage to the Snack Wrap. The Snack Wrap was arguable
            the best item that McDonald's has ever released and is missed and
            adored by millions of people. If you agree, sign the petition at the

      <h2>Why Was It Discontinued?</h2>
      <div>
        <div class="discontinued-info">
          <p>
            The snack wrap was officially discontinued in 2016 because of
            underwhelming sales and its time consuming construction. Compared to
            other items, it took workers a significant time to construct.
            Workers would have to steam the tortilla, prepare the chicken, and
            then assemble and fold the wrap into the cardboard box.
          </p>
          <p>
            McDonald's corporate policy allows for a maximum of 90 seconds for
            each customer at the drive through. But with the introduction of the
            snack wrap, this policy was nearly impossible to fulfill when a
            customer ordered a snack wrap. According to one franchisee owner,
            the snack wrap took at least three minutes to make.
          </p>
          <p>
            According to a general manager in the Hastings Mcdonald's location,
            "It took 20 seconds alone to steam a McWrap tortilla. Chicken had to
            be chopped and stuffed inside, along with sauce, bacon, lettuce,
            tomato, and cucumbers, depending on which of the nine varieties of
            McWrap a customer ordered. The whole thing then had to be rolled
            tight enough to fit into a slim cardboard box designed to make
            McWraps easier to eat while driving. Tortilla rolling turned out to
            be an inexact science. Sometimes the finished wraps were too big for
            the boxes and had to be rerolled. Fitting them in quickly and
            consistently 'was a nightmare,'" (Annette Snyder,
            https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2015-mcdonalds-franchises).

            <h3>NUTRITION</h3>
            <p>
              Americans are becoming more health conscious than ever. Many
              people are straying away from fast food because it is often deemed
              unhealthy. However, the snack wrap was relatively healthy when
              compared with many other items. A grilled chicken wrap was only
              181 calories, 2.1 grams of fat, 0.79 grams of salt, but had 13
              grams of protein. Bringing back this item would introduce a
              healthy menu option for McDonald's customers.

            <h3>PRICE</h3>
            <p>
              Not only was the Snack Wrap relatively healthy, it was affordable
              as well. Back when it was sold in 2016, its price was $1.49.
              Adjusting for inflation, that comes up to around $2.09. Even
              rounding to $2.50, this item was very affordable and competitively
              priced.
